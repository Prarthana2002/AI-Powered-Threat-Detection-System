# 🚀 AI-Powered Threat Detection System
This project is an AI-driven cybersecurity tool that detects anomalies in network logs and error messages using Google's Gemini AI and Reinforcement Learning (RL). It also integrates a Telegram bot to send real-time security alerts.

🔥 Features
Anomaly Detection: Uses AI to classify inputs as "Anomaly" or "Normal".
Reinforcement Learning (RL) Decision-Making: Suggests appropriate security actions based on risk levels.
Real-time Alerts: Sends Telegram notifications when a threat is detected.
User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for ease of use.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Google Gemini AI (for anomaly detection)
Reinforcement Learning (for decision-making)
Telegram Bot API (for alerts)
Streamlit (for UI)

🚀 How to Use
Run the Streamlit App
sh
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Enter a network log or error message in the text box.
Click "Predict" to analyze the input.
If an anomaly is detected, an RL-based decision is made:
"Mitigation" → Suggested actions.
"Alert" → Sends a Telegram notification.
